Born from a library I implemented as part of my masters project, pyL-systems is a framework for building L-systems in python.

pyL-systems currently supports the following types of L-system:

  * Deterministic
  * Stochastic (random)
  * Parametric

Context sensitive systems are on their way; the original library supported these, but the modifications I've made mean there is some more work to do before they can be re-included in this library.
